Analytics in sports is based on data and statistical analysis. That's the essence of it. Sports data analytics is the analysis of performance data involving athletes to identify players' strengths and 
weaknesses. There is a lot of room for expansion in the auxiliary businesses where sports data
analytics is being applied. It is predicted that the market for sports data analytics will exceed $4.5
billion by 2025. A major use of numbers and advanced data analysis are the two pillars of sports analysis. Therefore, the overview of the project will be a Case Study
where that is analyzed how soccer matches are played and player evaluation and projects the
results in the form of data visualization. The numbers represented in the case study help the
coaching staff to train the players accordingly and could also create excitement and enthusiasm
in the fans who love the game. Playing soccer is one of the lovable sports across many nations
and bringing academics together with a passion will be like having the ability to combine
business and pleasure all in one project.
The tools used in the project:
● Programming Language: Python.
● Data Analysis: Microsoft Excel, Jupyter Notebook.
● Data Visualization: Tableau
In this case study, the main focus is on the player's performance on and off the field, figuring out
how the team can win matches by applying different strategies and techniques with the help of
numbers. And finally, increase the team’s value in the market from a business point of view and
make the team win and earn money with the help of my product. We are graduate students studying
for a Master’s in Information Systems where we learned both management skills and technical
skills in real time. With the help of these traits, we are confident about our idea and hope it gets
executed well!
